# AI Librarian: Voice-Interactive Book Recommendation System

## üìñ Project Overview

AI Librarian is an innovative full-stack web application designed to revolutionize how library users discover and interact with books. It functions as an intelligent, voice-interactive librarian, moving beyond traditional keyword searches to provide accurate, context-aware book recommendations based on natural language queries. Leveraging advanced AI techniques, this system aims to make information access more intuitive, engaging, and personalized.

This project was proudly developed as a final project for the Computer Technology department.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **üó£Ô∏è Voice & Text Interaction:** Seamlessly interact with the AI using both voice commands and text input, offering flexibility to users.
-   **üß† RAG Architecture:** Employs a robust Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture to provide answers grounded in a curated knowledge base, significantly reducing "hallucinations" and ensuring factual accuracy.
-   **üîç Semantic Search:** Discovers books based on the *meaning* and *context* of the user's query, rather than just matching keywords, powered by a highly efficient FAISS vector store.
-   **üåê Bilingual Support:** Designed to understand and respond effectively in both Thai and English, featuring intelligent language detection and appropriate Text-to-Speech (TTS) voice selection.
-   **üöÄ Hybrid AI Model Integration:** Strategically utilizes the Groq API for lightning-fast language detection and initial understanding, combined with the Google Gemini API for high-quality, nuanced response generation.
-   **üéôÔ∏è Continuous Voice Mode:** Offers a hands-free, continuous conversational experience, allowing users to engage in a natural, back-and-forth dialogue with the AI.
-   **üé® Modern & Responsive UI:** Presents a clean, user-friendly interface with toggles for light/dark themes and language preferences, ensuring an accessible and pleasant user experience across devices.
